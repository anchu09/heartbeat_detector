# heartbeat_detector
This repository contains the code and documentation related to my Final Degree Project on beat detection with neural networks.

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Among them, cardiac arrhythmias, which refers to abnormal heart rhythms, are a common problem that can lead to serious health consequences, such as strokes or heart failure. Therefore, accurate and efficient detection and classification of arrhythmias are essential for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.

In this project, we have explored the use of neural networks for the detection and classification of heartbeats from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Traditionally, the diagnosis of arrhythmias has been based on the ECG, a non-invasive test used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. However, ECG interpretation can be challenging and error-prone, especially for less experienced healthcare professionals.

## Goals
The main objective of this work has been to investigate the use of neural networks for the detection and classification of heartbeats. For this, we have developed neural network models trained and tested with ECG signals obtained from the PhysioNet database. Various tests have been carried out to find the configuration that maximizes the accuracy of the model.
